Updates to come that

* add ability to render actual pictures as flashcards
* store data and stats in some form of db
* adjust cards rendered to user depending on learning i.e. less need to replay words you already have learned
* expand phrase set and translations
* auto translations
* groups of nouns/verbs etc.
